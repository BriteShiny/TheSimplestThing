			Apparently you knew to click on the
			<a href="Iteration-1.2.html">Navigation</a> link or you would
			not be reading this. Good.

		<p>
			So how is a link created? By enclosing the text in an <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_a.asp" target="blank">Anchor</a> tag.
			Following is how the source of the link looks:
		</p>
		<p>
			&lt;a href="Iteration-1.1.html"&gt;Navigation&lt;/a&gt;

			HTML is comprised of tags, or elements, that determine the behavior and rendering
			of the page. This is the <i>Markup Language</i> part of the HTML acronym, which 
			stands for(Hypertext Markup Language).
			You can see that the anchor tag is created by wrapping the markup between a less than (&lt;) and a greater than (&gt;) symbol. The markup
			itself consists of identifying the <b>element</b> "a" and its <b>attributes</b>, in this case href (hypertext reference),
			which indicates where the link should navigate to.
			
			The link on the Anchor tag opens W3C Schools, 
			I'm not going to go through an explanation
			
			Hypertext Markup Language. What is hypertext? According to the 
			<a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="blank">W3C</a>, 
			<a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="blank">"hypertext is text which contains links to other texts".</a>
			We are so used to this concept by now we don't think much about it. But it was revolutionary.
			And it is still critical to understanding web development.

		<p>
			<a href="Iteration-1.1.html">Navigation</a>
			is the first principle of the web.
