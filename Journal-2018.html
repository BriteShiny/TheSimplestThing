My literary career began with comic books. I learned to read from Superman, Batman and the Amazing Spiderman, along with Aquaman, Wonderwoman, The Flash and, especially, The Joker. My artistic career started long before, of course. Like any child, I loved to draw and color. I remember once my mother bringing me a Casper the Friendly Ghost Coloring Book from the grocery store when I was ill. My first paint set came from <a href="https://wild-bohemian.com/hipshops.htm">The Psychedelic Shop on Haight Ashbury in San Francisco</a>.

There is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Ross">Alex Ross</a> exhibition in town.

The battery in my trusty, rusty Windows Phone finally decided it had had enough and went belly up. 
It was about time. It was out of service, running Windows 8. Besides, nobody uses a Windows Phone anymore.

In its place I was issued my first iPhone
