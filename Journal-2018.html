                My literary career began with comic books. I learned to read from Superman, Batman and the Amazing Spiderman, along with Aquaman, Wonderwoman, The Flash and, especially, The Joker. My artistic career started long before, of course. Like any child, I loved to draw and color. I remember once my mother bringing me a Casper the Friendly Ghost Coloring Book from the grocery store when I was ill. My first paint set came from <a href="https://wild-bohemian.com/hipshops.htm" target="_new">The Psychedelic Shop on Haight Ashbury in San Francisco</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm afraid I can't say I've followed comics much as an adult. I don't plan my vacations around <a href="http://www.comicon.com/">COMICON</a>; in fact, getting the link was the first time I've ever been to the site. I once started exploring a shop in Virginia Beach (or was it Chesapeake?), but it didn't take. Purely coincidentally, I just passed another comic books shop, <a href="http://www.twebcomics.com/">The Tangled Web</a>, on the way to a friend's housewarming party recently. Odd, their web site has to be one of those web site production sites, which the owner has been remiss in completing.

            <p>
                What do you expect? Comics have always been associated with slackers. What surprises me more is that it is obviously on of those web building sites. I would think these guys would be wizzes at web development. There home page isn't bad.

            <p>
            My renewal of interest in comics did not arise from the discovery of a comic book store, however. There is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Ross">Alex Ross</a> exhibition in town.
            </p>
            <p>
            Ross was a disciple of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Loomis" target="_new">Andrew Loomis</a>, who taught at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Art" target="_new">American Academy of Art, though much earlier than the years Ross attended (Loomis died in 1959).

                Are books <i>really</i> dead???
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is another myth:<br/>
                No matter <i>how</i> hard you work,<br/>
                no matter how <i>much</i> you persist,
                you'll <i>never</i> become what you want.

                The book quotes Campbell:
            </p>
            <p>
                Myth is the secret opening through which the inexhaustible energies of the cosmos pour into human cultural manifestation. Religions, philosphies, arts, the social forms of primitive and historic man, prime discoveries in science and technology, the very dreams that blister sleep, boil up from the basic magic ring of myth.
                -- Joseph Campbell, The Hero with a Thousand Faces (1949)

                Having just completed a major OnBase release, I'm returning to my wellness project. When looking at my notes, I noticed it had been exactly a year to the month that I last reconnected with Azure.

        The battery in my trusty, rusty Windows Phone finally decided it had had enough and went belly up. 
        It was about time. It was out of service, running Windows 8. Besides, nobody uses a Windows Phone anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
        In its place I was issued my first iPhone
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-Silver-16GB-Verizon/dp/B06WW11CV4">Apple iPhone 6 Model MG5X2LL/A</a>
        </p>
        <p>
        I miss the navigation buttons. It seems to me like there is a lot of wasted real estate on the phone next to the Home button.

        The preceding is a demonstration of one of the complications of writing HTML directly: I had to escape all the tags.
